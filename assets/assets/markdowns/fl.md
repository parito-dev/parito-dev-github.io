# Fly | 2020
## Unity - C# #
## Duration - 4 months
I have always loved aviation and flight simulation. When the legendary Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise was announced to be brought back with FS2020, I was so excited that I wanted to make a flight game of my own.
## Keypoints
* Creation of a fast real-time, self-aware procedural world generation system optimized for mobile platforms.
* Implementation of an advanced state machine that other game systems such as player, audio system, ad system, GUI handler, and more rely on.
* Port and improvement to Unity of the achievement system implemented for project Nukleon.
* Creation of a custom simplified physic engine to approximate complex physic behavior to provide significant performance improvements compared to previous implementation using Unity physics.
