# Nukleon | 2019
## Cocos Creator - Javascript - Typescript
## Duration - 2 months
Nukleon was the first step into a venture to understand and gain a better understanding of the mobile game market for future professional development purposes.
The game concept was loosely inspired by a Harry Potter game level I used to play and love younger.
## Keypoints
* Extension of cocos creator GUI framework to provide missing features 
and smoother more refined handling, especially of scroll behaviors.
* Implementation of a procedural achievement system.
* Implementation of a simple state machine for managing player state.
