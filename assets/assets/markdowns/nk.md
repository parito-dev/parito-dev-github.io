# Nukleon | 2019
## Cocos Creator - Typescript
## Duration - 2 months

Nukleon is an attempt to understand the world of mobile game development and publishing.
The game idea was loosely inspired by a Harry Potter game level I used to play and love as a child.
## Keypoints
* Extension of cocos creator GUI framework to provide missing features 
and smoother more refined handling, especially of scroll behaviors.
* Implementation of a procedural achievement system.
* Implementation of a simple state machine used for player handling.
