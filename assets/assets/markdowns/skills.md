# How did I learn my skills?
## Self-taught
I have always been very self-driven to learn about things I care for. As this have always been a great passion for me, I  have spent a lot of my free time over the past 11 years and to this day in its exploration and learning, desiring to acquire and improve my knowledge and skills by the means of researches, experiments, and projects. 
## 2018 - 2021 | Business Management - University of Ankatso, Antananarivo, Madagascar. 
During the 3 years of study, we had business,statistic, and economy oriented Comoputer Science and Programming courses which despite the totally different fields still provided to me a much better understanding of programming concepts, that I regularly apply on my game related projects.
