# Learning experiences
## Self-taught
I have always been very self-driven to learn about things I care for. I  have spent a lot of my free time over the past 11 years learning and improving my programming knwoledge by the means of researches, experiments, and projects.
## 2018 - 2021 | Business Management - University of Ankatso, Antananarivo, Madagascar. 
During the 3 years of study, we had business,statistic, and economy oriented Computer Science and Programming courses which despite the different fields still provided to me a much more firm understanding of programming concepts, which I do regularly apply on all of my projects, game related or not.
