# Space | 2016
## Blender Game Engine - Python
## Duration - 1 month
A space physic simulation inspired by the game "Universe Sandbox 2" with an accurate units ratio. It includes simulation of the Earth's orbit around the sun, and orbit of earth satellites such as the Moon's orbit, the International Space Station's orbit and imaginary satellites used as a demonstration of geosynchronous, geostationary and ME orbits.
Simulation should be relatively accurate for up to 3 months in real-time mode and to around half a 1 month in maximum accelerated mode because of engine limitations.
