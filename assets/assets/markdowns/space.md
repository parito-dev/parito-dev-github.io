## Blender Game Engine - Python
## Duration - 1 month
A space physic simulation inspired by the game "Universe Sandbox 2" with accurate units ratio. It includes simulation of the Earth orbit around the sun, and orbit of earth satelites such as the Moon orbit, the International Space Station orbit and imaginary satellites used as demonstration of geosynchronous, geostationary and ME orbits.
Simulation should be relatively accurate up to 3 months in real-time mode and to around half a 1 month in maximum accelerated mode.
