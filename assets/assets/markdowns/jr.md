# Juicy Run | 2021
## Unity - C# #
## Duration - 8 days
First attempt at producing an hyper casual game based on researches and data analysis of trends in the hyper casual game industry. I was interested in knowing the economic viability of working on hyper casual games as a solo part-time developer, while still being a student.
## Keypoints
* Mostly relying on tools and codebase developed for "Fly".
* Not part of initial development: Creation of a CI/CD pipeline centered on allowing faster development as a solo developer, later part of the project Kazoo.
