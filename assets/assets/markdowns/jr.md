# Juicy Run | 2021
## Unity - C# #
## Duration - 8 days
Juicy Run is my first attempt at producing a game based on research and data analysis of trends in a cibled market: in this case, mobile hyper-casual. I was interested in knowing the economic viability of working on this genre as a solo part-time developer, and a student.
## Keypoints
* Mostly relying on tools and core systems developed for "Fly".
* ## Not part of initial development: 
    * Creation of a CI/CD pipeline based on game-ci centered on allowing faster development as a solo developer, later part of the Kazoo project.
