# Ivato airport for MSFSX | 2020
## Python - OpenCV - MCX - QGIS API - FSX terrain SDK
## Duration - 3 months
Set of Python console tools to automatically:
* Fetch Digital Elevation Models, aerial imagery and landscape vectors from selected servers.
* Recolorize aerial imagery based on reference pictures or colorsets.
* Generate water and transition masks for aerial imagery from OSM datas.
* Create fsx auto-gen data (buildings, trees,...) from OSM datas and MCX auto-detection on aerial imagery.
* Convert all assets into .bgl scene format for MSFSX-based platforms.
## Context
From January to April 2020, I have been working on bringing a new up to date version of the Ivato airport for MSFSX-based platforms, FSX and P3D, for the Malagasy Flight Simers Group. For this project, I wanted to provide the best quality terrain for the entire Analamanga region while using the limited, and poor quality data available. As such large scale work was not envisageable manually, the development of specialized, efficient, automated tools was required.
