# Ivato airport for MSFSX | 2020
## Python - OpenCV - MCX - QGIS API - FSX terrain SDK
## Duration - 3 months
Set of Python console tools to automatically:
* Fetch Digital Elevation Models, aerial imagery and landscape vectors from selected servers.
* Recolorize aerial imagery based on reference pictures or color sets.
* Generate water and transition masks for aerial imagery from OSM data.
* Create FDC auto-gen data (buildings, trees,...) from OSM data and MCX auto-detection on aerial imagery.
* Convert all assets into .bgl scene format for MSFSX-based platforms.
## Context
From January to April 2020, I have been working on bringing a new up-to-date version of the Ivato airport for MSFSX-based platforms: FSX and P3D, for the Malagasy Flight Simers Group. For this project, I wanted to provide the best quality terrain ever made for the entire Analamanga region while using the limited, and poor quality data available. As such large-scale work was not conceivable manually and alone, the development of specialized, efficient, automated tools was required.
