Kazoo is a WIP toolset aimed to accelerate and ease the development with unity of games for mobile platforms. \
Kazoo.Platform is a Node-based Unity Editor tool for the creation of procedurally generated platforms. It is mainly designed to allow extremely fast prototyping and creation of hyper-casual platformer-type games, however, it can be easily adapted and extended to any other similar needs. Usage demonstration can be seen in the latest releases of Juicy Run in which simple conversion took around 15 minutes of work.
