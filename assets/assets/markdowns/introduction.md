# Who am I?
I am Jannyfer, 21, from Madagascar. I am in love with Programmation, especially when applied for anything related to game creation since a very young age as it is a form of art in my eyes. I am self-motivated, love logic-driven actions and very thoughtful plannings to get by in life.
## My goals
One of my main goals has always been to participate in game development, by first being a developer myself and in the long run working on owning and managing my own game Studio.
I have dedicated the last 3 years to the in-depth exploration and planning of this career path by the mean of my study and by being a solo developer. 
And I believe I am now ready for the next step to reach my goals which would be to get valuable work experience in a team-driven environment to apply and extend my knowledge furthermore on fulfilling projects.
