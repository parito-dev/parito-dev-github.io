# Who am I?
I am Jannyfer, 21, from Madagascar. I am in love with Programmation, especially when applied for anything related to game creation since a very young age as it is a form of art in my eyes. One of my main goals has always been to participate in game development, by first being a developer myself and in the long run working on owning and managing my own game Studio.
