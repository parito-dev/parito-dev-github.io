# Who am I?
I am Ny Avo Randriamamonjy Harifenitra Herinando Jannyfer, 23, an Unity engine | C# game programmer from Madagascar. I am in love with Programmation, especially when applied for anything related to game creation since a very young age as it is a form of art in my eyes. I am self-motivated, goal driven and love logic-driven actions and very thoughtful plannings to get by in life and as such, I would be extremely thrilled to work and collaborate with like minded people and have new learning experiences.
