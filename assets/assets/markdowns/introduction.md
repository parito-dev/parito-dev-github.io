# Who am I?
I am Jannyfer, 21, from Madagascar. I am in love with programmation especially when used for anything related to game creation since a very young age as it is a form of art in my eyes. I have spent a lot of my free time over the past 11 years in the exploration of this passion, desiring to acquire and improve my knowledge and skills by the means of researches, self-teaching, and works on projects and experiments. 
# Current goals
One of my main goals have always been to participate in game development, either by being a developer myself or by working on owning my own Game Studio, up until this point, my path to achieve it was by the mean of education. However, local covid related events in the past 2 years have made the current situation in my country a barrier for the pursuit of a proper and decent education. \
After a lot of reflexion over the past few months, I genuinly believe it is more suitable to put a hold for now and jump a huge step forward by focusing on developing a career in the game industry: I would really love to work in a professional environment to apply and extend my knowledge and to be able to get work experiences with and as a team on fullfilling projects.
